SHEAF exploratory data analysis code
=======

This repository is for SHEAF exploratory data analysis, and for exporting a combined dataset for model construction.  Each heading contains functions that produce analysis for a particular dataset.  Each function is named to describe the output it provides, along with the dataset type.


EQIP
=======

EQIP stands for Environmental Quality Incentives Program.  From weather to pests, and from a lack of time to markets, each American farmer faces a unique set of challenges. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) helps agricultural producers confront those challenges â€“ all while conserving natural resources like soil, water and air.

This voluntary conservation programs helps producers make conservation work for them. Together, NRCS and producers invest in solutions that conserve natural resources for the future while also improving agricultural operations. 

Through EQIP, NRCS provides agricultural producers with financial resources and one-on-one help to plan and implement improvements, or what NRCS calls conservation practices. Using these practices can lead to cleaner water and air, healthier soil and better wildlife habitat, all while improving agricultural operations. Through EQIP, you can voluntarily implement conservation practices, and NRCS co-invests in these practices with you.


**SHEAF_eqip_map.R:**  This function maps EQIP farming practices, using leaflet.  The function can be called as such: 

    SHEAF_eqip_map(2014, "Vegetative Barrier")
    
    WHERE: the first input is the year of EQIP, and the second is the farming practice.  A full list of all farming practices are below, and are also included in the header of the function.

**SHEAF_eqip_barplot_year.R:**  This function creates a barplot of a particular farming practice, by dollars paid, for a state, across all years.  The function can be used as such:
    
    SHEAF_eqip_barplot_year("Idaho", "Vegetative Barrier")
    
    If a particular practice is not present for the selected state - function will kick out a statement that says: "selected practice has no dollars paid for chosen state"
    

SHEAF_eqip_barplot_practice.R:  this function creates a barplot of all farming practices for a state, for a range of years.  The function is used as such:

    SHEAF_eqip_barplot_practice("Idaho", 2005, 2010)
    
    The first year is the start year, the last year is the end year.  If a user wants only one year, start year and end year are the same.
